# Breed (type alias) example
# breed creates a transparent alias — the new name is interchangeable
# with the original type.

breed Nickname = string
breed Score = int

nyan name Nickname = "Nyantyu"
nyan score Score = 42

# breed aliases work just like their underlying types
nya(name + " scored " + to_string(score) + " points!")
nya(name)
nya(score)
